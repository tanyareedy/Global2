Cough Cough

i cant feel your pain
but i  know what you feel
i swear its very evident

She cold cold girl
her heart must be Steel

but something must kill a man
i might as well enjoy it.
its just how i feel.
she tried to stab me but i am iron born
body impressive
bank account more.

all my Niggas 4 times 2
we well fed nobody lacking
getting in paid Bits
they can feel the chain reaction
when i hit the block.

i am vanity Personified

you Nigga telling lies
you can barely 4 * 2
you gram feeds u living the life
but ur mama can barely feed


i never look for trouble
but i never run either.
man claimed he was a beast
now i tamed made him dance to my beats

i fear no evil
infact i dine with him daily

Multi reason to move on when i quiting
The sky was the limit now we aiming for the starts.

i am on high speed on a journey
but i aint even driving
the wheel is turning on e own

We moving too fast
i hope your not in my lane.
In search of the future
erasing the past..
i pray i make history
and dont just exist.

but if i dont either
it is what it is

All this money gotta stack it up
all the bills i gotta slash it down




I speak the truth
Like is see it with my Third eye
The never get the message they must be using ravens.
i never pass the blunt i just Dragon.

Vala morgulis
All man must Die
am a supernova
they cant kill this Star

i pray every Nigerian have Jollof in their pot.
but they can barely....
the cops is killing is off.
Green in their eyes, they must be jealous of Us.

i barely read the Bible
lately i have  been reading deep codes
i must be Davinci.


Nigga be hating
i guess they wanna be
if they only knew they truth.
i dont even know the real me.

many days of isolation
i am very focused
i climb to the mountain just to roll my sticks and stones up


i move with a plan or i dont move at all
the smoke is all cleared
man is feeling clairvoyant

i can barely breath
dont you open up the window
i need this shit to heal

i wish my Niggas will smoke less
and pop less
to late
 its all we know
**drag blunt

lots of late nights i hope my efforta are not in vain
Oh lord !!!


17 and helf
hell yea she mature

oh no dont let lucifer in.

i am what is promised

i am what the sun is
a star


i  customised and reinvented myself
upgraded my frame work recreated myself

when they doubted me, i  chuckled
they couldnt see the Magic
no one belived in me
i belived in myself


my diamonds most be charmed
it gets the ladies petrified

i only only spell, how to multiple that money


all my insecurities i erased that

i got the Key and the power yes

Niggas look uop to me for answers yes

My mama said the day i was born  i was blessed


i sipped a drink i would never sip again
i did somethings i would never do again

staying anyway
because u just wanna believe
believe in your self see how awesome that is.


never took the elevator
Nigga i took to the stairs
just i could contemplate and understand the steps
its to be great

believing in you
not just because you wanna
but because is true.


i know your about to give up now
you should probably do
but think back years from now
what you need from you.
what will your child
grow up and say to you

hold my hands lemme guide you


Dont copare to any1 except myself


i inserted my  element now i
see her source code
heart .....

i am a beast  am a Monster
reality is a bitch i divorced her


we wear the shoes
but we dont play the same game
in the same picture
i i got a different frame.

dont fear the  belly of the beast
cus i got a beast in my tummy

picked up a chick from Shoprite
took her home ad she robbed me
Damn  i shopped wrong

white gave you a name and you took it
but

slave mentality
always running back to the slave master
because he dont know nothing else.


he never believed i could right a couples of lines
it wasn't jealousy
it was fear in his eyes

i was doing what i did just to survive
how many times have we had that line before
your a criminal.

i taught  fear how  to have courage
i told death to take notes
i am hanging on  a life line its a tiny rope.

we gonna leave for ever

steady winning but i am loosing my mind

i dont want the fame or the clout
i just wanna be the Nigga with the bag

addicted to proving everybody wrong
everything they never expected i have become.

Last time I called my plug he pulled up with a whip.
Damn.
I made this nigga rich


anyday he dont pick up i get worried

even though i robbed me

my plug wont pick up...
i really hope he is well
Getting worried  i hope he ain't be taken down by the Cops


££££££
she fucking like five dudes but i dont really mind
as  long as she come back to me with  all  their Jewellery  then its alright
she ma bad bitch watch her do a split
splash

i am aiming for the peak
giants milk thats whats in me


niggas got a lot of smoke but no fire
i yell dracarys  watch all my enemies disappear
two fingers in the air
thats not a peace sign
please pass the blunt
Nigaa awith an attituded
i am climbing mountains
constantly gaining new heights
so i can burn my sticks and stones

someone broke the remote
the balling never pause
lucrubating non-stop



niggas cant handle the heat because i come with the fury


i see the truth but never say it
they too young to understand it

shit hit me down to my soul you can feel it in ur bone marrow


you niggas dont want to cross me or get in my lane
in have been doing this over and over again

green in my eyes
blue on my tongue
red on my fingers

i got As on every test but i failed the booty test

i need new enemies
old ones become friends.
