                The Republic of Malta is a Southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the
                Mediterranean Sea. It lies to the south of Italy, east of Tunisia, and north of Libya. The country
                covers just over 316 km2 making it one of the world's smallest peaceful countries. Malta has two
                official languages, which are Maltese and English.

                    The Republic of Malta is a historic southern European nation located in the Mediterranean Sea. For
                    what Malta lacks in size, it more than makes up with culture, heritage and beauty. Nestled among its
                    rugged coves and rolling hills are chic harbour towns, ancient temples and historic cathedrals. The
                    island comes to life in the summertime, with a calendar crammed with carnivals and festivals hosted
                    all around its scenic coastline.

                    Malta is one of a handful of European countries offering a citizenship by investment programme that
                    is both highly respected and expedient. Known as the Malta Individual Investor Programme (Malta
                    IIP), the Programme is the first European citizenship by investment programme to be recognized by
                    the European Commission. The Malta IIP was designed for ultra-high net-worth individuals wishing to
                    obtain full rights of citizenship in an EU country.
